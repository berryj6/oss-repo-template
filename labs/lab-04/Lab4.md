**Importance of a license:**

It is important to choose a licenses for your own open source projects for a variety of reasons. First, a licenses allows for the development of a community because it provides users and developers with a set of rules on how they can modify and distribute the project. Additionally, some licenses protect your work so that you are given fair credit for your work.

It is important to avoid using unlicensed projects because it is unclear whether or not you can distribute or modify the projects source. This could lead to legal issues if the original source owner decides that you do not have any rights to the work.

**Why the Web beat Gopher:**

I agree with the claim that the Web development team did a better job than the Gopher team. This is because the Gopher team planned to require payment for a license to the project which meant that the development process of the protocol could not be scrutinized by the public. Ultimately, the failures of the Gopher development team lead to the widespread adoption of the World-Wide-Web protocol we see today.

**Andriod License:**

Andriod uses the Apache license 2.0 which is similar to the MIT license, in the sense that it is copyright; however, the Apache license 2.0 does not allow the free use of the trademarks contained within the code. This is useful for Google because they can monitize their product by requiring companies to purchase a license for the Andriod trademark while still benefitting from the open source nature of the code as explained [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Licensing).
